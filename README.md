# CS300-Projects
The repository records all the projects from CS300 Spring at UW-Madison

## P01
### A local urgent care clinic is looking for our assistance automating its case management protocols.

● Comfortably implement a procedural program using static methods in Java <br>
● Explain the protocols used with oversize arrays  <br>
● Verify the correctness of a static method which uses arrays by designing and implementing a
boolean tester method in Java

## P02 Dancing Badgers
### This assignment involves developing a graphical application to simulate badgers dance show on a basketball arena.

• Practice how to create and use objects <br>
• Develop the basis for creating an interactive graphical application <br>
• Give you experience working with callback methods to define how your program responds
to mouse or key-based input

## P03 Dancing Badgers II
### This assignment involves refactoring the code from the P02 Dancing Badgers I program into a more object-oriented organization.

• Learn how to create and use instantiable classes <br>
• Learn how to refactor an existing code into a more object-oriented programming fashion <br>
• Practice using java.util.ArrayList class <br>
• Improve your experience with using the graphic processing library <br>

## P04 Exceptional Care
### Our urgent care clinic is back, and is interested in making some design improvements to their patient tracking software.

● Implement a simple object with basic accessor and mutator methods <br>
● Explain the different requirements of using a static vs. a non-static method <br>
● Verify the correctness of a method which uses exceptions by designing and implementing a tester method which includes exception handling <br>

## P05 Dancing Badgers III
### Back in P03, you took code previously written code and refactored it to a developed object-oriented design.

• Implementing an interface <br>
• Experience organizing code in an object oriented fashion that takes advantage of inheritance relationships between your classes <br>
• Practice overriding methods from a parent class or interface <br>
• More practice with instantiable classes <br>
• Seeing polymorphism being used in action <br>
• More practice with using the graphic processing library and learn how to use PApplet class defined in the processing graphic library directly to develop a graphic application from the scratch <br>

## P06 Changemaker
### In this assignment you will use recursion to solve a variation of the change-making problem.

● Formulate a recursive solution to a problem by describing the base cases, recursive cases, and how to decompose it into smaller subproblems <br>
● Implement a recursive solution to a problem by making recursive calls to solve the subproblems, and combining the results <br>
● Compare the recursive formulations of similar problems <br>
● Explain why recursion can be a useful problem-solving tool <br>
● Develop unit tests to verify the correctness of your algorithms

## P07 Twitter Feed
### In this program, you will model a simple Twitter feed as a linked list of tweets. 

● Explain how data is stored in a singly-linked list, including how additional elements are added in locations other than the head or tail of the list <br>
● Contrast multiple different approaches to implementation of the Iterator interface <br>
● Identify the ways in which an Iterable class can be used

## P08 Bottle Factory
### You are provided a driver class simulating the working of the bottle factory machine which takes in empty bottles and produces filled & capped utilizing four queues. You will implement two variants of the queue data structure and a queue iterator.

• Get more practice on implementing a generic interface <br>
• Get practice and experience both implementing a data structure queue and using that queue to solve some other problems <br>
• Get practice using both linked and circular indexing array queues <br>
• Learn how to implement the Iterable interface and an iterator to iterate over a queue <br>
• Develop unit tests to verify the functionality of a simple data structure

## P09 Password Cracking
### Using this information we are going create and store passwords into a binary search tree (BST) and choose one of three different criteria to order the tree by based on how we want to attack the system

• Implement common binary search tree (BST) operations <br>
• Design test scenarios and detect errors in BST implementations <br>
• Organize code using recursion
